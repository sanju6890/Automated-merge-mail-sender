I am Sanjay Kumar. I am from Bihar Sharif, Nalanda (Bihar). I am glad to inform you that COVID-19 pandemic is going to end probably by september in India.
So, we all have to keep following the latest guidelines issued by the Government. Have a good diet, and consume something which boosts our imunity. Practice yoga or lite exercise too.
Students keep learning by enrolling into various online courses. And help your parents at home.

Thanking you!!
